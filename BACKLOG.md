This project severely needs some clean-up. At the top of my head here
are some things to note:

 1) The code should be split up into smaller modules
 2) Error handling could be way better
 3) The exception-wrapping thing could be nicer
 4) The service should give meaningful responses on errors
 5) The service should always repond with JSON
